# JavaScript Console Quiz Game

This project is a simple quiz game made using basic JavaScript concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, and string methods. The quiz runs completely inside the **browser console** and does not use any HTML or DOM elements, as required by the assignment.

## 📌 Features
- Uses an array to store questions and answers.
- Uses a `for` loop to ask each question one by one.
- Takes user input using `prompt()`.
- Gives immediate feedback using `alert()`.
- Converts input to lowercase and trims spaces for accurate checking.
- Uses a function (`runQuiz()`) to organize the code.
- Tracks the score and shows the final result at the end.

## 📌 How to Run the Quiz
1. Open your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).
2. Press the shortcut to open the console:  
   - **Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + I`  
   - **Mac:** `Cmd + Option + I`
3. Go to the **Console** tab.
4. Open the `quiz.js` file and copy the entire code.
5. Paste it into the console and press **Enter**.
6. The quiz will start immediately with `prompt()` and `alert()` boxes.
